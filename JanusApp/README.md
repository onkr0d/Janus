# JanusApp

App part of the Janus project.

## Functionality
It updates the gaming status at the [Janus server](https://github.com/onkr0d/Janus/tree/main/JanusServer). Authentication will be done using JWT tokens.
It prevents interaction with UI will updates are happening in order to prevent desync, thus forcing strict synchronization. It also supports light and dark mode :D
